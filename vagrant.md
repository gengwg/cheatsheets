On mac:

```
brew install --cask virtualbox
brew install --cask virtualbox-extension-pack
```

### install vagrant

https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

On mac:

```

### list running vms

```
vagrant status
```

### Saving an existing Vagrant box

```
vagrant package --output ubuntu22godocker.box
```

### ssh into a guest using NAT in VirtualBox

In VM Network panel, click on advanced, click on Port Forwarding button. In there set up a rule:

```
Host IP: 127.0.0.1

$ vagrant up
The provider 'virtualbox' that was requested to back the machine
'default' is reporting that it isn't usable on this system. The
reason is shown below:

Vagrant has detected that you have a version of VirtualBox installed
that is not supported by this version of Vagrant. Please install one of
the supported versions listed below to use Vagrant:

4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0

A Vagrant update may also be available that adds support for the version
you specified. Please check www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html to download
the latest version.
```

===>

For Mac users, `brew cask install virtualbox` recently changed to install Virtualbox 6.1 . If you still want to install Virtualbox 6.0 with homebrew for use with Vagrant, use the following command to install the most recent formula that still installed 6.0:

```
brew cask uninstall virtualbox
brew cask install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/7e703e0466a463fe26ab4e253e28baa9c20d5f36/Casks/virtualbox.rb
```

Or download older version and install here:

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_6_0

This is due to Vagrant 2.2.6 doesn't work with VirtualBox 6.1.0 yet. Hopefully future release of Vagrant will fix this.

The SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status. Vagrant

-------
Providers, such as VirtualBox, VMWare, Amazon AWS, and Digital Ocean, are the services where your virtual environment will be created and hosted. 
Provisioners are tools that allow you to quickly configure your server to your exact requirements. The two most common provisioners used with Vagrant are Puppet and Chef.

The SSH key of the git server is not known/trusted. When you clone the repo manually on the VM, you get a prompt asking to verify the fingerprint, right?

You can either skip the host key verification in ~/.ssh/config (or globally in /etc/ssh/config or alike):

Host git.example.com
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
Or you can add the key in advance to ~/.ssh/known_hosts (or /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts). For example:

ssh-keyscan -H git.example.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

--------------------------
Vagrant experienced a version conflict with some installed plugins!
This usually happens if you recently upgraded Vagrant. As part of the
upgrade process, some existing plugins are no longer compatible with
this version of Vagrant. The recommended way to fix this is to remove
your existing plugins and reinstall them one-by-one. To remove all
plugins:

    rm -r ~/.vagrant.d/plugins.json ~/.vagrant.d/gems

Note if you have an alternate VAGRANT_HOME environmental variable
set, the folders above will be in that directory rather than your
user's home directory.

The error message is shown below:

Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "bundler":
  In Gemfile:
    vagrant (= 1.7.4) ruby depends on
      bundler (<= 1.10.5, >= 1.5.2) ruby

  Current Bundler version:
    bundler (1.10.6)
This Gemfile requires a different version of Bundler.
Perhaps you need to update Bundler by running `gem install bundler`?
Could not find gem 'bundler (<= 1.10.5, >= 1.5.2) ruby', which is required by gem 'vagrant (= 1.7.4) ruby', in any of the sources.

=================
Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually
because the filesystem "vboxsf" is not available. This filesystem is
made available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.
Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the
guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
Vagrant box. For context, the command attemped was:

set -e
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`getent group vagrant | cut -d: -f3` vagrant /vagrant
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` vagrant /vagrant

The error output from the command was:

/sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: No such device
===>
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

Then saw error in the box:
/tmp/vbox.0/Makefile.include.header:112: *** Error: unable to find the sources of your current Linux kernel. Specify KERN_DIR=<directory> and run Make again. Stop.

This seems due to vagrant box need update.

vagrant box update
Fixed the issue.
