## Deleting a specific URL suggestion in Chrome

https://superuser.com/questions/398385/deleting-a-specific-url-suggestion-in-chrome

To delete a single autosuggested URL, start typing the address as you normally would. Then, when the unwanted autocomplete suggestion appears, use your keyboard's arrow keys to highlight the suggestion in the drop-down menu below the address bar.

Finally, press `Shift+Delete` and poof! The suggestion disappears.

On a Mac, you may have to press `Shift+Fn+Delete`.
(Fn is at left bottom corner on laptop keyboard).
