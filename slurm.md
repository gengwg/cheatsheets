Association is a combination of cluster, account, user name, and (optional) partition name.
Each association can have a fair-share allocation of resources and a multitude of limits.

Always upgrade slurmdbd first. slurmdbd can communicate with SLURM commands and daemons at the same
or recent earlier versions. e.g. slurm 2.4 can not communicate with 2.5 RPCs.
