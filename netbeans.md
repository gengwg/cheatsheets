#### Automatic indentation
press `shift + ctrl + f` simultaneously.

#### Automatic System.out.println
You can get the text System.out.println("") by typing `sout` and pressing the tabulator key

#### Auto-completion of your code
If you have, for example, the variable String familyName; in your code, you do not need to always write familyName. Try what happens when you type in f and then press CTRL and space simultaneously. You can also use auto-completion with commands like while by typing in w and then CTRL + space.

#### Run the code
In NetBean, You can run the code by selecting `Run`->`Run File` from the menu or by pressing `Shift+F6`. To build the package, `Cmd + F6`.

#### Renaming
Variables, methods and classes (we will learn about these in the next set) need to have descriptive names. Often, a name is not that describing and needs to be changed. In NetBeans, it is really easy to rename things. Just select and "paint" the name you want to change with the mouse. Then press ctrl and r simultaneously, and write the new name.
